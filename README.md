# dodge-asteroids
Dodge the Asteroid! Game web project is a game where the player must avoid or destroy asteroids in their way. The goal is to survive as long as possible and rack up the most points. If the player survives for 2 minutes, they win the game!

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JS

Technologies: Zim.JS

Goal: Originally a school project, a couple of elements were added to improve on the game. A start frame was added to act as an introduction to the game as well as provide an appealing visual to a potential player. A timer was integrated into the game environment to keep track of how long the player is surviving (in seconds). A counter was also integrated into the game environment to keep track of the amount of asteroids destroyed. A pop up panel was added so that when the player hits an asteroid, the pop up will show the player how many asteroids were destroyed, how long the player survived and that their species has been exterminated!

Future improvements: I plan on adding a "Try again" button so that the player can reload the game if they want to play again.
