# dodge-asteroids
Dodge the Asteroid! Game web project is a game where the player must avoid or destroy asteroids in their way. The goal is to survive as long as possible and rack up the most points.

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JS

Technologies: Zim.JS

Goal: Originally a school project, a couple of elements were added to improve on the game. A start frame was added to act as an introduction to the game as well as provide an appealing visual to a potential player. A timer was integrated into the game environment to keep track of how long the player is surviving (in seconds). A counter was also integrated into the game environment to keep track of the amount of asteroids destroyed. A pop up panel was added so that when the player hits an asteroid, the pop up will show the player how many asteroids were destroyed, how long the player survived and that their species has been exterminated!

Future improvements: I plan to add a "Try again" button so that the player can reload the game if they want to play again. I would also like to add a win condition to the game (as the game currently goes on endlessly) so that players can actually win the game (i.e., if the player survived for 2 minutes = 120 seconds, you win!).

Updates:
Nov 2 2019: Integrated a win condition (if the player survived for 2 minutes, they win). Music has also been integrated into the game along with background visual changes. Music credits go to the following:
